# Genshin Impact Gallery

This project is a **Genshin Impact Character Gallery**. It allows users to browse characters, weapons, and artifacts, with various filtering options for elements (Pyro, Hydro, Anemo, etc.) and a search feature.

## Features

- **Interactive Gallery**: View and filter characters by elements like Pyro, Hydro, Anemo, Electro, etc.
- **Responsive Design**: The gallery is fully responsive and works on mobile and desktop devices.
- **Hamburger Menu**: Mobile-friendly navigation with a hamburger menu.
- **Search and Filter**: Real-time search and filtering by element type (e.g., Pyro, Hydro, etc.).
- **Hover Effects**: Hover effects on cards for a smooth, interactive experience.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Background and theme color adjustments for a clean, modern interface.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: JavaScript framework for building the user interface.
- **CSS (with animations)**: Stylesheets for layout and design. Utilizes flexbox and grid for responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity, including filtering, search, and hamburger menu logic.
