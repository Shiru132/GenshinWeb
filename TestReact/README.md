# Genshin Impact Guide & Gallery

This project serves as a **Genshin Impact Guide & Gallery**. It allows users to browse and learn about **characters**, **weapons**, and **artifacts** from the game. The gallery is interactive, and users can filter characters by their **element type** (Pyro, Hydro, Anemo, etc.).

## Features

- **Character Gallery**: View detailed character profiles, including names, images, and elemental affiliations.
- **Weapons**: Explore the vast array of weapons available in Genshin Impact, each with its unique characteristics.
- **Artifacts**: Learn about different artifact sets and how they affect characters' performance.
- **Filter by Element**: Filter characters, weapons, and artifacts by their elemental affiliation.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for specific characters, weapons, or artifacts by name.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive design for mobile and desktop users.
- **Interactive Hover Effects**: Hover over items for smooth animations and additional information.
- **Hamburger Menu**: A mobile-friendly navigation menu.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: JavaScript framework for building the user interface.
- **CSS (with animations)**: Stylesheets for layout and design. Utilizes flexbox and grid for responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity, including filtering, search, and hamburger menu logic.
